/**
 * <p>
 * Provides actions from extensions for menu and
 * {@link org.eclipse.ui.IActionBars} contributions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This abstract class should be extended by clients of the
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent</b> extension point for
 * top-level and nested <b>actionProvider</b> elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link CommonActionProvider}s may be declared as top-level elements in the
 * extension point (e.g. an <b>actionProvider</b> element at the root of the
 * extension point). Alternatively, <b>actionProvider</b> elements may be
 * nested under a <b>navigatorContent</b> element, in which case they are
 * considered to be "associated" with that content extension. For more
 * information, see the <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent</b>
 * extension point.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each action provider will have the opportunity to contribute to the context
 * menu when a user right clicks and also contribute to the {@link IActionBars}
 * each time the selection changes. Clients should re-configure the
 * {@link IActionBars} each time that {@link #fillActionBars(IActionBars)} is
 * called (which is once per selection changes). {@link #updateActionBars()}
 * will never be called from the {@link NavigatorActionService}. This behavior
 * is required since each selection could determine a different set of
 * retargetable actions. For instance, the "Delete" operation for a custom model
 * element is likely to be different than for a resource.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Therefore, each extension will have an opportunity to contribute to the
 * IActionBars based on the <b>possibleChildren</b> expression of the enclosing
 * <b>navigatorContent</b> extension or the <b>enablement</b> expression of
 * the <b>actionProvider</b> (for both top-level <b>actionProvider</b>s and
 * nested <b>actionProvider</b>s which only support a subset of the enclosing
 * content extensions <b>possibleChildren</b> expression).
 * <p>
 * Clients may extend this class.
