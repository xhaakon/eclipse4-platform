 * asks the Memory View if the it is currently pinned to a memory block. If the
 * view is currently pinned, then the SELECT delta is ignored.
 * 
 * If the ADDED delta and SELECT delta are recieved in separate nodes, then the
 * delta will be handled as-is and would not take the pinning state of the
 * memory view into account.
