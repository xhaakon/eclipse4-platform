========== Eclipse Build Input March 29rd 2004 ==========<br>
<H3>Breaking API Changes</H3>
<p>The methods in <code>AbstractTextSearchResult</code> related to mapping matches to files and editors have been moved to two
new Interfaces: <code>IFileMatchAdapter</code> and <code>IEditorMatchAdapter</code>. 
Both <code>findContainedMatches(...)</code> methods have been renamed to <code>computContainedMatches(...)</code> in 
order to better express the fact that they might be non-trivial.
<code>AbstractTextSearchResult</code> now has two new methods <code>getFileMatchAdapter</code>
and <code>getEditorMatchAdapter</code> to get adapter objects. The default implementation
of these methods is to return null.
Clients who have empty implementations of either set of methods can just delete the
methods. Clients who had meaningful implementations can implement the interfaces
and return <code>this</code> from the new getter methods. Note that the <code>computeContainedMatches(...)</code>
methods have a new parameter <code>AbstractTextSearchResult result</code>.</p>
<p>The attribute "targetClass" of extension point "org.eclipse.search.searchResultViewPages" has been renamed to "searchResultClass".</p>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input March 29rd 2004 ==========<br>
<H3>Breaking API Changes</H3>
Subclasses of <code>AbstractTextSearchResultPage</code> now can decide if they want to support 
flat list  and/or tree layout by passing the appropriate flags (<code>FLAG_LAYOUT_FLAT, FLAG_LAYOUT_TREE</code>) to
the super constructor. Methods dealing with flat vs. tree layout have been changed to use the 
flags instead of a boolean now, for example <code>setFlatLayout(boolean)</code> changed to <code>setLayout(int layout)</code>.
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input March 23rd 2004 ==========<br>
The new search API should be reasonably stable by now.  See source folder "new search" in the non-internal packages.
Some (minor changes) should be expected as we move along, but clients are now welcome to go ahead and use the API.

========== Eclipse Build Input November 18th 2003 ==========<br>

<!-- Add what's new below and end each line with br tag -->

- Added a new interface IReplacePage. If an ISearchPage implements IReplacePage,
  a "Replace" button will be shown in the search dialog (when the page is active).
  The text search page implements that interface.
- Extended the text replace dialog to support "Replace in File" and "Replace All" actions.

- Added a new attribute "canSearchEnclosingProjects" to the extension point
  "org.eclipse.search.searchPages". If the attribute is set to true, the search
  dialog scope area will have a new radio button labeled "Enclosing Projects".
  Search page contributors whishing to support search in projects enclosing the
  current selection have to set this attribute to true and handle the new search
  scope constant org.eclipse.search.ui.ISearchPageContainer.SELECTED_PROJECTS_SCOPE.
  The file search page supports search in enclosing projects.
- Improved project scope
